### gMIS Background

> “In a demand-driven opinion, we faced increasing requests of creating enormous table-based management tools for operation teams in years of 2005-2010 at ChinaM, an affiliate of [Telstra](http://telstra.com.au) in Beijing.  
> Those shared some common functions and most of them just needed to achieve basic goals (CURDLS) for a table.
> So we conducted many practices to find one to meet this kind of demand, for all, forever.”

Its source code locates in [-GitHub-Wadelau , and its live demo lives in -gmis .  
  
This project has been started and pondered during the study in Univ. of Derby,
