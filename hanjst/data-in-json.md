## Data in JSON
### Cross Languages of Back-end
---
Hanjst uses JSON for data transition from back-end to front-end.
JSON is **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation).

As described in JSON homepage, 
>It is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the [JavaScript](http://javascript.crockford.com/).
>
>JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
