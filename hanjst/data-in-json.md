## Data in JSON
### Cross Languages of Back-end
---
Hanjst uses JSON for data transition from back-end to front-end.

JSON is **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation).

As described in [JSON homepage](http://json.org), 
>It is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the [JavaScript](http://javascript.com/).
>
>JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

Therefore JSON is an ideal data structure for [GWA2](https://ufqi.com/dev/gwa2/) with Java, PHP, Perl, Python and Aspx. From a engineer's perspective, JSON is also easily-understood and clear, clean and concise textual representation.

Even out of GWA2, Hanjst can work well with any other unlisted languages in back-end.

According to JSON homepage, almost every language has at least one available and open source library to transform data in its own structure from and to JSON. 


### Friendly with JavaScript in Front-end
---
Hanjst reads data in JSON from the client-side page.

JSON is a built-in object in JavaScript which is one of three components of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in front-end. So it is quite friendly for Hanjst to retrieve data from `Hanjstjsondata`.

That's also another key point which drives us make this commitment to choosing JSON as the carrier of inter-change data.
