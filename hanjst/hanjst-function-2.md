1. `{include}`

`{include}` allows Hanjst to embed one template file or part of another template into the other template.  That is to say, `{include}` are used for including other template(s) in the current template. All variables available in the current template are also available within the included template(s).

The usage of `{include}` looks like as below.

```html
{include file="$embeddedTemplate"}
```
