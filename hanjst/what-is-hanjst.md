Han JavaScript Template Language and Engine.

Hanjst is a template language aiming at present a page of Web contents.

Hanjst is a template engine which parse the pages written in Hanjst template language.

Han is the surname of my wife, and one of the given names of my daughter and son.

Han is also Chinese in Pinyin, Hànrén (汉人).

Hanjst is intentionally designed to stop further "Reinventing the wheel" for HTML template engines though it sounds ridiculous.

### Why Hanjst?

It is easy to create another new template language and engine with JavaScript. therefore, there are too many JavaScript-based templates and corresponding engines for HTML.

Frankly speaking, the basic reason is that it is a simple and easy piece of work to make replaces work with a template and its engine which is designed to parse the template sentences into final representations.

Unfortunately, there is no state of art work for this job.
