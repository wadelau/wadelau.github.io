### What is Hanjst

Hanjst is a template language aiming at present a page

Han is the surname of my wife, and one of the given names of my daughter and son.

Han is also Chinese in Pinyin, Hànrén.

Hanjst is intentionally designed to stop further "Reinventing the wheel" for HTML template engines though it sounds ridiculous.
