## Hanjst Ready-to-go
### A Standalone Example
---
Let's rolls up sleeves and have a ready-to-go example to demonstrate what we have just discussed before and validate them from a practical perspective of engineering.

The example blow will show a news items list on a page.

1. Original Template File 

(eg08131156)

```html
<html>
<head>News List</head>
<body>
<div id="Hanjstloading" 
	style="width:100%;height:100%;z-index:99;opacity:0.92;position:absolute;background-color:#ffffff;"> 
	Loading... 加载中... 
</div>
<div id="newsList">
<ul>
{foreach $newsList as $n}
	<li>
		{foreach $newsList[$n] as $np}
			<dt>{$np}: {$newsList[$n][$np]}</dt>
		{/foreach}
	</li>
{foreachelse}
	<li>No data.</li>
{/foreach}
</ul>
</div>
<div id="Hanjstjsondata" 
	style="display:hidden;">
	HANJST_JSON_DATA
</div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="Hanjst.js" async></script>
<noscript>JavaScript Required for Hanjst.</noscript>
</body>
</html>
```

Copy these lines and as a file: `news.html` .

2. Hanjst Server-side in PHP 

(eg08131157)

```php
//- resp data container
$respData = array();

//- data preparing
$newsList = array(
	array("id"=>12, "title"=>"Hanjst is releasing to pulic."),
	array("id"=>34, "title"=>"Hanjst Ready-to-go."),
	array("id"=>56, "title"=>"Hanjst has outpaced all other jst.")
);
$respData['newsList'] = $newsList;
$jsonDataStr = json_encode($respData);

//- template contents processing
$tplFile = "news.html";
$jsonDataPlaceHolder = "HANJST_JSON_DATA";
$tplContent = file_get_contents($tplFile);
$tplContent = str_replace($jsonDataPlaceHolder, $jsonDataStr, $tplContent);

//- output
print($tplContent);
```

Copy these lines and save them as a file: `news.php` .  Then upload `news.php` and `news.html` to a folder under a web server which can execute PHP scripts.

One more, please also upload `Hanjst.js` into the same folder along with `news.php` .


3. Raw Template File

The host web server will execute the `news.php` and the PHP scripts will read the contents of `news.html`, then the news data will be merged into the outputs of the HTTP response.

If we make a request to the web host, i.e., http://example.com/path-to-project/news.php , the scripts will print out a raw template file as below.

(eg08131158)

```html
<html>
<head>News List</head>
<body>
<div id="Hanjstloading" 
	style="width:100%;height:100%;z-index:99;opacity:0.92;position:absolute;background-color:#ffffff;"> 
	Loading... 加载中... 
</div>
<div id="newsList">
<ul>
{foreach $newsList as $n}
	<li>
		{foreach $newsList[$n] as $np}
			<dt>{$np}: {$newsList[$n][$np]}</dt>
		{/foreach}
	</li>
{foreachelse}
	<li>No data.</li>
{/foreach}
</ul>
</div>
<div id="Hanjstjsondata" 
	style="display:hidden;">
	{"newsList":[
		"0":{"id":12,"title":"Hanjst is releasing to pulic."},
		"1":{"id":34,"title":"Hanjst Ready-to-go."},
		"2":{"id":56,"title":"Hanjst has outpaced all other jst."}
	]}
</div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="Hanjst.js" async></script>
<noscript>JavaScript Required for Hanjst.</noscript>
</body>
</html>
```
Compared with its raw contents (eg08131156), the only difference is that `HANJST_JSON_DATA` has been replaced with actual news data which will be further parsed by Hanjst engine.


4. Final Hanjst-parsed HTML

It is show time!

After the raw HTML is loaded, Hanjst will be triggered automatically and try to read all content of the current `BODY`.

Then the magic Hanjst engine starts to load JSON data, and extracts all template sentences and parse all of them into pure JavaScript and executes them again to reload the `BODY` with freshly contents generated by the pure JavaScript.

The happy end comes with its final Hanjst-parsed HTML as below. It is the desirable presentation consist of jointly collaboration from front-end designers and back-end engineers.  

(eg08131205)

```html
<html>
<head>News List</head>
<body>
<div id="Hanjstloading" 
	style="width:100%;height:100%;z-index:99;opacity:0.92;position:absolute;background-color:#ffffff;"> 
	Loading... 加载中... 
</div>
<div id="newsList">
<ul>
	<li>
			<dt>12: Hanjst is releasing to pulic.</dt>
			<dt>34: Hanjst Ready-to-go.</dt>
			<dt>12: Hanjst has outpaced all other jst.</dt>
	</li>
</ul>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

This is all! The quick start consists of three files, `news.html`, `news.php` and `Hanjst.js` and presents four stages of the Hanjst template engine, Original template file, Server-side data, Raw template contents and Final pure HTML presentation.


### GWA2 in Java
---
Hanjst is the default template engine for [GWA2](https://github.com/wadelau/GWA2), so it is easy to have a look at the process of Hanjst in a web application by running a demo for GWA2 in Java.

Developers and designers are welcome to deploy a GWA2 instance to see what we have talked about with Hanjst, its great features and powerful expressions in pure JavaScript.

Some of codes from GWA2 in Java have been referenced in this document before, such as [Hanjst Variables](https://github.com/wadelau/GWA2).
