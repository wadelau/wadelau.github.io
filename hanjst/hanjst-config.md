## Hanjst Configurations
### Runtime Settings

Except from what we have introduced in previous section, there are some other variables which can be set as custom values.

```javascript
window.HanjstDefault = {
	"TplVarTag": "$", //- variables from response starting with this, e.g. $pageTitle
	"JsonDataId": "Hanjstjsondata", //- an html element id which holds server response json data
	"LogTag": "Hanjst", //- inner usage
	"ParseTag": "__JSTPL__",  //- inner usage
	"IsDebug": false, //- verbose output in console
};
```
Keys listed in above can be set in window.Han
