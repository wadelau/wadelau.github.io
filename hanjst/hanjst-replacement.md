## Hanjst Server-side Replacements
### JSON Data Placeholder
---
We have seen lots of examples written in Hanjst template language till now. But most of them are codes snippets or fragments due to that they are written on a single proposal to illustrate one of the aspects of Hanjst.

In fact, the raw template file looks not so pretty as the examples presented above.
The following example shows that we place an placeholder in the position where we will put all JSON data from server-side in.

```html

```
