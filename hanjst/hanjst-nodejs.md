## Hanjst Run in Server-side
### Hanjst with node.js
---

Hanjst has potential power to run in server-side with `node.js`. Just like any other JavaScript libraries which run with `node.js` in back-end environments.

Developers from front-end or back-end are encouraged to import Hanjst into `npm` for convenient and widely usage.
