## Hanjst Class
### Backend Overview
---
We have switch our default template engine from Smarty to Hanjst.

Smarty itself is good enough and strong enough to meet the requirements of the production environment, which is one of the reasons Smarty won in our candidates list before. Smarty's concise expression is very close to natural language, making it easy to learn and easy to use. Advanced applications of Smarty keep this simplicity, so the learning curve is not steep.

We have integrated Smarty in GWA2PHP and it works very well. When we have developed GWA2Java, we found that Smarty fans on the Internet had moved Smarty to the Java version, Smarty4J, so we also integrated Smarty4J logically.

Unfortunately, Smarty4J is a version of about 7-8 years, and has not been updated since, only compatible with the syntax of Smarty 2, which greatly limits the further development of GWA2Java.
